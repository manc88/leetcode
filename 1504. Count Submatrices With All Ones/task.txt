Given a rows * columns matrix mat of ones and zeros, return how many submatrices have all ones.


              [1,0,1]
              [1,1,0]
              [1,1,0]
              
Output: 13
Explanation:
There are 6 rectangles of side 1x1.
There are 2 rectangles of side 1x2.
There are 3 rectangles of side 2x1.
There is 1 rectangle of side 2x2. 
There is 1 rectangle of side 3x1.
Total number of rectangles = 6 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 13.
